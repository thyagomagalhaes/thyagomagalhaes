👋 Hi, I’m @thyagomagalhaes. 📫 How to reach me https://www.linkedin.com/in/thyago-magalhaes/

👀 I’m interested in Software Architecture, Development, DevOps and Infrastructure

🌱 I'm currently improving myself in Gateway API with Kong and Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ, GraphQL, REST, gRPC; and studying (a lot!) service mesh with Istio, Terraform     and Go Lang.

👀 The next steps will be with Observability, Open Telemetry, Ansible, GitOps and deployments on GCP and Azure.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate at BRQ Digital Solutions as a backend developer; especially using the stacks: AWS, Microservices, API Rest, Spring ecosystem, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Terraform and API Gateway.
